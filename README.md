# Spring Boot Sqlite

A simple spring boot service with a sqlite database. 

## Goals
The main goal of this project is to prove to that I can achieve certain goals using spring-boot, before trying my hand
at rewriting the project in kotlin.

### Steps Taken
1. Basic Crud Spring boot app in java and maven
2. Added a non-standard sqlite DB... Mostly to prove to myself that I can
2. Added a rest service
3. Used `gradle init` to convert to a gradle project

## Running the App
In maven:
```
mvn -Dspring.profiles.active=sqlite spring-boot:run
```
In gradle
```
I'm working on it, I may need another plugin
```
